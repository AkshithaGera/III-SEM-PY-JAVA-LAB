# Palindrome Checker 

This is a Python script that checks if a word is a palindrome.

A **palindrome** is a word that reads the same backward and forward.  
Examples: `madam`, `civic`, `level`.

##  How It Works

- It takes a word as input
- Reverses the word
- Compares original and reversed word
- Outputs whether it's a palindrome

##  Run the Script

```bash
python palindrome.py
